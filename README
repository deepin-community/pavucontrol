News

   Sun Aug 15 2021:

   [12]Version 5.0 released. Changes:
     * Support for switching Bluetooth codecs (new in PulseAudio 15.0).
     * Support for locking card profiles (new in PulseAudio 15.0). Locking
       a profile prevents PulseAudio from automatically switching away
       from that profile on plug/unplug events.
     * New translations: Asturian, Basque, Belarusian, Galician, Hebrew,
       Kazakh, Norwegian Bokm√•l, Sinhala, Slovenian
     * Updated translations: Catalan, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese
       (Traditional), Croatian, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German,
       Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian, Norwegian
       Nynorsk, Polish, Portugese, Portugese (Brazil), Slovak, Spanish,
       Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian.
     * Some bug fixes.
     * New dependency: json-glib.
     * Minimum gtkmm version bumped to 3.22.

   Tue Mar 5 2019:

   [13]Version 4.0 released. Changes:
     * There can now be only one pavucontrol window open at a time. Trying
       to start pavucontrol for a second time brings the first window to
       foreground.
     * Added a "Show volume meters" checkbox to the Configuration tab.
       Disabling the volume meters reduces CPU use.
     * Improve the use of space (remove useless margins and paddings).
     * Use a more appropriate icon for the channel lock button.
     * Better channel label layout, prevents volume sliders from getting
       unaligned.
     * Maximum latency offset increased from 2 to 5 seconds to accommodate
       AirPlay devices that often have higher latency than 2 seconds (this
       is not that useful on newer PulseAudio versions, though, because
       the latency is reported much more accurately than before).
     * New --version command line option.
     * New translations: Chinese (Taiwan), Croatian, Korean, Norwegian
       Nynorsk, Lithuanian, Valencian.
     * Updated translations: Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese,
       Polish, Swedish.
     * Dropped support for Gtk+ 2.
     * Bumped the minimum supported libpulse version to 5.0.
     * Improved compatibility with newer Glade versions.

Overview

   PulseAudio Volume Control (pavucontrol) is a simple GTK based volume
   control tool ("mixer") for the [32]PulseAudio sound server. In contrast
   to classic mixer tools this one allows you to control both the volume
   of hardware devices and of each playback stream separately.

   Everybody loves [33]screenshots.

Current Status

   Works perfectly.

Documentation

   There is not much to say. Just run pavucontrol and see for yourself.

Requirements

   Currently, pavucontrol is tested on Linux only. It should work on most
   Linux distributions.

   pavucontrol requires [34]gtkmm and glademmm installed.

   Obviously pavucontrol requires an installation of [35]PulseAudio.

Installation

   As this package is made with the GNU autotools you should run
   ./configure inside the distribution directory for configuring the
   source tree. After that you should run make for compilation and make
   install (as root) for installation of pavucontrol.
